<h1 class="animated bounceInRight"><br> <br><br> The cover for “Music with Changing Parts” was one of my most favourite outcomes of the record designs for one of my least favourite songs. If I didnt have a headache before listening to that, I sure did afterwards. I tried to find a figure that looked as fed up as I felt listening to that. I used a plate to create a golden halo around her head that I felt reflected how sore and swollen my brain felt from hearing the repetition of this piece. I also tried to create some tension between the hammer and the china cups to try and show how each time the beat repeated, it felt like I was one of those china cups being hit with the hammer.<br><br><br> </h1>
